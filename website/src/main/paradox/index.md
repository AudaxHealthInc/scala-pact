Scala-Pact is a library for generating Consumer Driven Contract files in Scala projects following the PACT standard using [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/). Includes supporting tools that use Pact files to verify and stub services.

ScalaPact is intended for Scala developers who are looking for a better way to manage the HTTP contracts between their services.
