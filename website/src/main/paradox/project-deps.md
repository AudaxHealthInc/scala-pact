# Library dependencies
The Pact integration test library itself depends on a range of Scala/Java libraries.

## Http4s
[Http4s](http://http4s.org/) powers ScalaPact's stubber.

## Argonaut
[Argonaut](http://argonaut.io/) is used to read and write the JSON Pact files.

## ScalaTest
[ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) is both our test suite of choice and the target for the ScalaPact implementation.

## Scalaj-Http
[Scalaj-Http](https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-http) is used for quick synchronous HTTP calls.

## Scalaz
[Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) is the glue that holds it all together.
